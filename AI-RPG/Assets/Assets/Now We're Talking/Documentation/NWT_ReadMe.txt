Now We're Talking! by Chatterware release version 1.08. March 28th 2022.

Thanks for purchasing 'Now We're Talking!' from Chatterware.  

New features in V1.08
We've fixed a small bug in the clip indexing, by adding an initialiser in the Awake method. NWT should now play voice clip 0 as the first clip.
We've added the ability for you to let some voice clips follow on the previous clip, so allowing 2 or more voice clips to 'run' together as a longer clip.  Add '++' to the filename of the voice clip you want to play the next clip.

New features in V1.07
Further integration with Pixel Crushers! Dialogue System - many thanks to Tony for his fast work on this! - now includes NWT_Phases

New features in V1.06
Added compatibility with Adventure Creator (courtesy of ChrisIceBox and Peter ~ Chatterware - thanks to Adamaze for the suggestion! )
(includes bool checkbox to let NWT know you are using Adventure Creator (or any external AudioSource other than NWT) plus an 'OnAwake' check for compatibility and adjustments as necessary)

New features in v1.05
Microphone input is now in beta in v1.05
small fix on mouth 3 makes it more responsive

New features in 1.04
Integration with Pixel Crushers! Dialogue System - many thanks to Tony for his fast work on this! - see documentaion in Dialogue System
NWT Documentation is still correct at v1.03

V1.03 was a major update so please BE AWARE it will BREAK previous versions and some re-working will be needed. However the update offers far more complex conversation possibilities.

There are full instructions on using the 'Now We're Talking!' demo scene in the UPDATED v1.03 documentation, please refer to it for fuller instructions than can be shown here.

USING THE DEMO:
Find the 'Now We're Talking!' prefab in the Hierarchy.  Activate and deactivate the 'NWT_PlayAudio' gameobject when you want the 'character'
to speak.  You can change the mouth shape to see the various mouths working using the 'Mouth Data Presets'slider from 1 to 2 to 3.

Notes about the Download:

Voice Packs:
We have included a few voice pack sound clips in the 'Now We're Talking!' download.  This is so you can be up and running very quickly.  The data in the  Mouth Data Presets has been averaged to work well out of the box with these samples.  When you first use NWT you may find it difficult to tune your voices and data, please look closely at our example voices and the the data supplied.

At a later date we intend to replace the hardwired data with Scriptable Objects so users will be able to load and save data for individual characters, and transport it between scenes.
